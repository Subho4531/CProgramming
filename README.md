# C Programming (ESCS-201)

## Syllabus

### **Unit 1: Introduction to Programming**
- Introduction to components of a computer system (disks, memory, processor, where a program is stored and executed, operating system, compilers, etc.).
- Idea of Algorithm: Steps to solve logical and numerical problems.
- Representation of Algorithm: Flowchart/Pseudocode with examples.
- From algorithms to programs: Source code, variables (with data types), variables and memory locations, syntax and logical errors in compilation, object and executable code.

### **Unit 2: Arithmetic Expressions and Precedence**
- Understanding arithmetic expressions.
- Operator precedence and associativity.

### **Unit 3: Conditional Branching and Loops**
- Writing and evaluation of conditionals and consequent branching.
- Iteration and loops.

### **Unit 4: Arrays**
- Arrays (1-D, 2-D), character arrays, and strings.

### **Unit 5: Basic Algorithms**
- Searching algorithms.
- Basic sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Insertion sort, and Selection sort.
- Finding roots of equations.
- Notion of order of complexity through example programs (no formal definition required).

### **Unit 6: Functions**
- Functions (including using built-in libraries).
- Parameter passing in functions: Call by value.
- Passing arrays to functions: Idea of call by reference.

### **Unit 7: Recursion**
- Recursion as a different way of solving problems.
- Example programs: Finding factorial, Fibonacci series, Ackermann function, etc.
- Quick sort or Merge sort.

### **Unit 8: Structures**
- Structures: Defining structures and arrays of structures.

### **Unit 9: Pointers**
- Idea of pointers and defining pointers.
- Use of pointers in self-referential structures.
- Notion of linked list (no implementation).

### **Unit 10: File Handling** *(Optional, if time permits)*
- File handling concepts and implementation (can also be covered as part of lab exercises).

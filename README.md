# C Programming(ESCS-201)

# Syllabus

**Unit 1: Introduction to Programming**
Introduction to components of a computer system (disks, memory, processor, where a programisstored and executed, operating system, compilers etc.) .
Idea of Algorithm: steps to solve logical and numerical problems. 
Representation of Algorithm: Flowchart/Pseudocode with examples.
From algorithms to programs; source code, variables (with data types) variables and memorylocations, Syntax and Logical Errors in compilation, object and executable code.

**Unit 2: Arithmetic expressions and precedence**

**Unit 3: Conditional Branching and Loops**
Writing and evaluation of conditionals and consequent branching
Iteration and loops

**Unit 4: Arrays**
Arrays (1-D, 2-D), Character arrays and Strings

**Unit 5: Basic Algorithms**
Searching, Basic Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion and Selection), Finding roots of equations,notion of order of complexity through example programs (no formal definition required)

**Unit 6: Function**
Functions (including using built in libraries), Parameter passing in functions, call by value, Passingarrays to functions: idea of call by reference

**Unit 7: Recursion**
Recursion, as a different way of solving problems. Example programs, such as FindingFactorial, Fibonacci series, Ackerman function etc. Quick sort or Merge sort.

**Unit 8: Structure**
Structures, Defining structures and Array of Structures.

**Unit 9: Pointers**
Idea of pointers, Defining pointers, Use of Pointers in self-referential structures, notionof linkedlist(no implementation).

**Unit 10: File handling (only if time is available, otherwise should be done as part of the lab)**
